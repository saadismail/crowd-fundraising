\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
This is a new self-contained product.

\section{Background}
The background of this project is the severe need of a consolidated platform which combines crowd-funding, crowd-sourcing and provides a platform for people interested in philanthropic and social services.

\section{Project Scope}
This project will consist of creating a marketable, and deploy-able application based on the concept of crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding. The modules of the project will in include a mobile application and web based front end where users can interact with the database.

\subsection{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Functional Database
  \item Web based application
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Out of Scope}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dynamic Website
  \item Mobile Application
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Objectives}
The objective of this project to solve the problem of having a consolidated platform where crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding is combined to be a ‘one-stop’ place for people seeking funds, companies/individuals looking to invest in great ideas, and individuals/organizations looking to form a team for a specific project.

\section{Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users
  \item Administrators
\end{enumerate}

\section{Operating Environment}
The project can be hosted on any PC platforms, regardless of architecture and operating system being used. The development, testing and official support is only for Intel based CPU with Linux Operating System.

\section{System Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to implement payment system, we will have to partnership with local and international banks.
  \item The system is open to spam, we are totally dependent on end-users to reduce spam.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
We are totally dependent on banks to handle payments to the projects and we will have to transfer payments manually to the end-users.

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
We will provide user-friendly, responsive and easy to use web interfaces for our customers. Those will be based on Bootstrap v4.

\section{Software Interfaces}
There are three main components of the product.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Front-end}\\
        Powered by Angular 2 (TypeScript)
    \item \textbf{Back-end}\\
        Powered by Node.JS and Express.JS
    \item \textbf{Database}\\
        Powered by MySQL
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
For initial release, the product will run on a single node but in future, the three software components can be deployed on different nodes to increase concurrency and optimizing the page load speed.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item HTTP(s) (80, 443)
    \item MySQL (3306)
    \item SMTP (465 - only outgoing)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
The project must be easily accessible and fast to the end-users. The page load time must be less than 10 seconds, even on slow internet connections. The interface must be user friendly and easy to use so that the user doesn't have any confusion or difficulty. The page rank of the website must be prepared according to the Google Page Rank Algorithm which will allow it to show up easily in Google Search Results.

\section{Safety Requirements}
Users, their payment information and other sensitive information must be handled safely. Moreover, the use of bots must be eliminated and great care will be taken to ensure that the personal details of the Users are not compromised in any way.\\\\ A two factor authentication system can be utilized to ensure that the login security of users is protected and no malicious attack will be made successful.

\section{Security Requirements}
The product must not be vulnerable to any known issues and other security bugs like SQL injection, XSS etc.\\\\The possibility of bots forming usernames and accounts must be eliminated and to do this, we will utilize Google Recaptcha which will ensure that the user is a human being. 

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
Code quality must be up-to the mark. Unit and Integration tests should be written after the initial release.\\\\All the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle must be followed. Moreover homogenization must be done in order to add clarity and consistency to our models and ensuring that all the stake holders clearly follow the process and can check that their requirements are being followed.
